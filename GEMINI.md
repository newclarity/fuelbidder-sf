# Gemini Project Notes: fuelbidder

This document contains notes generated by Gemini to understand the `fuelbidder` project.

## Project Overview

This is a Salesforce DX (SFDX) project designed as a "Fuel Bidder" application. It facilitates the management of fuel orders, deliveries, providers, customers, and related logistics. The data model is centered around custom Salesforce objects that represent key entities in the fuel delivery process.

## Key Technologies

- **Salesforce:**
    - Apex
    - Lightning Web Components (LWC)
    - Aura Components
    - SOQL
    - Custom Objects, Fields, and Tabs
- **JavaScript:** For LWC and development tooling.
- **Node.js/npm:** For managing development dependencies and scripts.
- **Shell Scripts:** For automation of setup and data management tasks.

## Development & QA Workflow

- **Linting:** `eslint` is used for JavaScript in LWC and Aura components. The configuration is found in `.eslintrc.json` files. Run with `npm run lint`.
- **Formatting:** `prettier` is used for consistent code formatting across all major file types (Apex, XML, JS, CSS, etc.). Run with `npm run prettier`.
- **Testing:** Jest (`sfdx-lwc-jest`) is used for unit testing Lightning Web Components. Run with `npm run test:unit`.
- **Git Hooks:** `husky` and `lint-staged` are configured to automatically run prettier and eslint on staged files before they are committed, ensuring code quality.

## Data Model

The application uses a series of custom Salesforce objects:

- **Account:** Standard object with custom record types: `Customer`, `Provider`, `Vendor`, `Other`.
- **Driver__c:** Stores information about drivers, including CDL details and safety ratings.
- **Provider__c:** Represents fuel providers, linked to an Account, with details on fleet size, service regions, and insurance.
- **Location__c:** Defines physical sites, likely for fuel delivery, linked to an Account.
- **Tank__c:** Represents individual fuel tanks at a Location, with capacity, current levels, and IoT device integration fields.
- **Fuel_Order__c:** The central object for managing a fuel order, linking a provider and customer.
- **Fuel_Order_Item__c:** Line items for a specific `Fuel_Order__c`, detailing delivery to a specific `Tank__c`.

## Scripts & Automation

The `/scripts` directory contains a suite of shell scripts for automating common tasks:

- **Scaffolding:** Scripts like `make-driver.sh`, `make-tank.sh`, etc., are used to create the necessary Salesforce metadata.
- **Data Loading:** `insert-data.sh` and `demo-data.apex` are used to populate the org with sample data from the CSV files in `/sample_data`.
